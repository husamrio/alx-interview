# 0x01-lockboxes

Contains interview coding challenges.
## Tasks to Complete
# Lockboxes
# The script in 0-lockboxes.py has been designed to fulfill the following criteria:
# You are faced with n locked boxes, numbered from 0 to n - 1, and each box may contain keys to other boxes.
# Implement a method named canUnlockAll(boxes) that checks if all the boxes can be opened.
# The method takes a list of lists called boxes as its parameter.
# Each box is represented by a list, and a key with the same number as a box can open that box.
# All keys are positive integers, and there might be keys that do not correspond to any boxes.
# The first box, boxes[0], is always unlocked.
# Return True if it is possible to open all boxes; otherwise, return False.
